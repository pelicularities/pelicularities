## Hello, I'm Grace ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer from Singapore. I love learning languages (both programming and human), musical theatre, and video games.

Other languages I've used: Python, PHP, C

Other frameworks I've used: Rails, Sinatra, React, Express, Django, Flask

Frameworks I want to try: Hotwire
