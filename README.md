## Hello, I'm Grace ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from Singapore. I love learning languages (both programming and human), musical theatre, and video games.

### Languages and Technologies
I mostly work in Spring Boot and Java these days, but if I need to throw together a quick script, I'll do it in Ruby or JavaScript.
